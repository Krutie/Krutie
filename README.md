## Hi, I'm Krutie 👋
I'm a front-end developer. I create interactive web stuff using Vue js and Nuxt js. Some other frameworks and libraries I also enjoy working with include GSAP, Laravel ⚡️ and Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup). I love writing ✏️ articles about what I learn and share with Vue/Nuxt community. You can find my blog-posts on my [ website](https://krutiepatel.com/blog), which is also created using 👑 Nuxt js.

Apart from this, I also love creating [colour-coded diagrams](https://krutiepatel.com/diagrams). I create them to capture and document my learning. Diagraming have been an effective tool in my learning journey of Laravel, Vue js and of course, my absolute favourite, Nuxt js.
